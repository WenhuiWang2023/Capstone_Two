# Natural Language Sentiment Analysis and model on Walmart Customer Review data

The Walmart Customer Reviews Dataset offers a wealth of insights into consumer sentiment and product feedback related to one of the world's largest retail giants. This dataset contains a vast collection of customer reviews, star ratings, and other relevant information that has been gathered through web scraping and data compilation. The key features include: Customer Reviews: Detailed textual reviews provide firsthand accounts of shopping experiences and product satisfaction. Star Ratings: Each review is accompanied by a star rating, allowing for sentiment analysis and product rating assessment. Review Dates: The dataset includes review submission dates, facilitating temporal analysis and trend detection. Product Identification: For some reviews, product identification details such as SKU numbers or product categories are provided. Sentiment analysis on the data found the key features that will promote or impair customersâ€™ experience. These information will not only help Walmart but also other retailers to improve their services. After that, I build model to predict customer rating based on review language by transfer learning and fine tuning on of pre-trained RoBERTa model (cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest) from hugging face.
